# GoAnimate Wrapper
This is an API wrapper for GoAnimate's Legacy Video Maker, which had been retired on *19th December 2019, 03:10 UTC*.	Unlike other services that attempt to sole the same problem, this project allows the LVM to access data peristence and is very portable.  Please keep in mind that not all features designed to run on the original API work properly.
